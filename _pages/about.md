I am a postgraduate student supervised by **Prof. Tao Zhang (IET Fellow, Head of Department)** in the Institute of Navigation and Control (**INC**) at **Tsinghua University**. 

Before stduying at Tsinghua, I received my B.E. in Mechatronics Engineering from University of **Beijing Institute of Technology** in 2019.
Besides, I worked as a research assistant in Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Intelligent Robots and Systems (**BAICIRS**) supervised by **Prof. Qing Shi (IEEE Senior Member) and Prof. Toshio Fukuda (IEEE President(2020))**.

Location: Main Building 428, Institute of Navigation and Control, Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China

Research Interests
======
My research interests include intelligent robotics and reinforcement learning. To be specific, my research focuses on trajectory planning of free-floating space robots using reinforcement learning and developing of small-scale quadruped robots capable of multi-modal motions. 
To develop a general-purpose learning framework, I am interested in studying topics including, but not limited to, **Reinforcement learning, Optimization, Biomimetic Robot Design, Control Theory, SLAM, Deep Learning, Dynamics Modeling and Simulation, Image Processing**.

When I was at BIT, I worked with Prof. Qing Shi and Prof. Toshio Fukuda to study the intersection of robotics and biology. For example, to realize the detection and operation in narrow spaces, I developed a miniature rat-inspired robot that captures a decent representation of an actual rat, and designed a hierarchical multi-modal locomotion controller based on optimization with bionic constraints. Our robot can execute multiple modes including crouch-standing action, walking forward, turning around, crawling and recovery from a fall. **This work won the best student paper award at IEEE AIM in 2019.**

After pursuing my master degree, I worked with Prof. Tao Zhang on the application of deep learning on space robots. For instance, traditional model-based methods have the singular problem in trajectory planning of free-floating space robots, so I designed a multi-target trajectory planning strategy of a 6-DoF free-floating space robot using reinforcement learning. On the other hand, in order to combine the perception, planning and control into an integrated system, I designed an end-to-end trajectory planning policy for a free-floating space robot, and implemented a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on maximum entropy to search the optimal policy.

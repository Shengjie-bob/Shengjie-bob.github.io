we propose a small-sized quadruped robotic rat (SQuRo) capable of multi-modal motion.

Main Work
======
* the mechanical design of a quadruped robot captures a decent representation of an actual rat. Unlike a conventional quadruped robot, a rat-like robot should also be similar to actual rats in terms of size, weight, and appearance. The optimal design of a flexible body allows a significant reduction of the turning radius, which had been previously difficult to achieve. The mechanical structure of SQuRo makes full use of the connecting rod mechanism, which can more accurately transfer movement more accurately and improve the maneuverability compared with the wire-driven mechanism.
* Multi-modal motion planning and control. On the basis of the substantially bio-inspired robot structure, we analyzed the dynamic stability and optimized the parameters to generate motion trajectories for the planning of multi-modal motions. The appropriate control parameters were optimized with multi-objective bionic constraints subject to stability and power limitations. Simultaneously, we realized a stable and fast motion transition, which improves the motion agility and environmental adaptability. 
* Field tests were carried out on the prototype to evaluate the basic motion performance and environmental adaptability of SQuRo. Owing to the bio-inspired flexible structure, SQuRo can perform various motions, such as crouching-to-standing, walking, crawling, and turning, and can recover after falling by controlling its limbs and cervical parts to appropriately adjust its center of mass (CoM). Moreover, SQuRo successfully passed through an irregular narrow passage (inner width of 90 mm), crossed an obstacle with a height of 30 mm, and achieved stable locomotion on a slope with an inclination of 15â—¦, which demonstrates its potential application to inspection tasks inside narrow spaces. 
* Compared with state-of-the-art quadruped robots of a similar scale, the newly developed SQuRo has a relatively elongated slim body and smaller weight. The minimum turning radius of 0.48 BL (body length) is much smaller compared with that of other robots. Moreover, SQuRo can achieve steady locomotion even after carrying a load equal to 91% of its own weight, which demon- strates its superior payload-carrying compared with small- sized quadruped robots. The proposed method can be easily extended to the development of other small-sized biomimetic robots inspired from terrestrial animals.

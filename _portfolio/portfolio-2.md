we propose a small-sized quadruped robotic rat (SQuRo) capable of multi-modal motion.

Abstract
======
Quadruped robots are very promising for use in real-world applications, but their operation in narrow spaces is still challenging. One solution for enhancing their environmental adaptability is to design a small-sized biomimetic robot capable of performing multiple motions. By capturing a decent repre- sentation of actual rats, we developed a small-sized quadruped robotic rat (SQuRo), which includes four limbs and one flexible spine. On the basis of the extracted key movement joints, SQuRo was subtly designed with a relatively elongated slim body and smaller weight compared with quadruped robots of the same scale. Accordingly, we propose a control framework for multi- modal motion planning with the coordination of the movements of the limbs and spine. Appropriate control parameters were tuned by multi-objective optimization with consideration to the bionic constraints and stability. The results obtained through a series of experimental tests reveal that SQuRo achieves superior motion performance compared with existing state-of-the-art small-sized quadruped robots. Remarkably, SQuRo has an extremely small turning radius (0.48 BL) and strong payload capacity (91% of its own weight), and it can recover from falls.
